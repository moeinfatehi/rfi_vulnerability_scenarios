# RFI Vulnerability Scenarios (challenges)
This repository is a Dockerized php application containing some RFI vulnerability challenges.<br><br>
**OWASP References:**
* **Classification**: Web Application Security Testing > 07-Input Validation Testing
* **WSTG**: Testing for Remote File Inclusion (<a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/11.2-Testing_for_Remote_File_Inclusion">WSTG-INPV-11</a>)</br>

# Bypass Techniques
The ideas behind challenges are:</br>
* PHP code injection using RFI
* RFI to RCE (Remote Command Execution)
* PHP filter bypass  

# Quick Start Using Docker
**Using docker hub (Quickest):**
1. To access the challenges, you need <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install">docker</a> installed.</br>
2. Run this command to pull and run the image from docker hub:</br>`sudo docker run -d -p 9004:80 moeinfatehi/rfi_vulnerability_scenarios`
3. Access the challenges with this URL: <a href="http://localhost:9004">http://localhost:9004</a></br></br>

Help:
```
-d: detached mode (You can use terminal after running command
-p: specifies port (you can change 9004 to whatever you want. If you don't have a web server on your host, set it to 80)
```

**Using docker-compose:**  
1. To access the challenges, you need <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install">docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">docker-compose</a> installed.</br>
2. Clone the repository</br>`git clone https://github.com/moeinfatehi/rfi_vulnerability_scenarios.git`
3. Open the main directory of the project (where docker-compose.yml file exists) and run: `docker-compose up`
4. Access the challenges with this URL: <a href="http://localhost:9004">http://localhost:9004</a>

# Attention
* **Do not** host these challenges **without** docker on your main operating system and web server, because any of these challenges are critically dangerous ones, if any hacker can access these challenges on your host webserver, your main OS can be attacked in different ways.</br>
* Using docker-compose which is described above will not have these type of impacts.
